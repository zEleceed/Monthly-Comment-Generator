# Classroom Management System

## Overview
The Classroom Management System is a tool for teachers to record daily notes on students. It saves these notes in .txt files in folders for each student, making it easy to keep track of their behavior and activities. These files can be used with AI tools to create detailed, easy-to-read reports for parents, improving communication and giving a clear view of each student's progress.
